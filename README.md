# ***Modern Hawaiian Monk-Seals and Ancient West Asian Spindle-Whorls: an Eccentric Database for Lily Woodard's LIS-545 B Term Project***

<sub> **Advisory information:** three files in this repository are sourced from the dataset titled “Hawaiian Monk Seal Telemetry Tag Deployments", published by NOAA’s Protected Species Division Hawaiian Monk Seal Research Program on *Data.gov*, and twelve others from the repository “The Textile Revolution” (WOLL), created by German researchers at the *Exzellenzcluster Topoi 264*, which was located through *re3data.org*. Four of the twelve files corresponding to WOLL contained metadata in a .JSON format, which had to be committed to this repository as code. Similarly, one of the three files from NOAA's dataset containing its metadata was committed from its .XML format to the repository as code. Of note is the fact that four .CSV files relating to spools, archaeological sites, spindle whorls, and loom weights in WOLL's "Textile Tool Database" have vanished and are unavailable for download. For that, they could not be added to this repository.</sub>
