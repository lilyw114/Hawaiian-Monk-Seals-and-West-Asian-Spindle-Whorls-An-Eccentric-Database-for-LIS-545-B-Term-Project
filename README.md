# ***Modern Hawaiian Monk Seal Populations and Ancient Southwest Asian/Southeast European Spindle Whorl Catalogs: A Slightly Eccentric Repository for Lily Woodard's LIS 545 B Term Project***

<sub> **Advisory information:** Three files in this repository are sourced from the dataset titled “Hawaiian Monk Seal Telemetry Tag Deployments", published by NOAA (the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) from their Protected Species Division Hawaiian Monk Seal Research Program on *Data.gov*. Thirteen others are sourced from the repository “The Textile Revolution” (charmingly abbreviated by its creators as 'WOLL'), published by German researchers at the *Exzellenzcluster Topoi 264*, located through *re3data.org*. Four of the thirteen files corresponding to WOLL contain metadata in a .JSON format, which had to be committed to this repository as code. Similarly, one of the three files from NOAA's dataset containing its metadata was committed from its .XML format to the repository as code. Of note is the fact that four .CSV files relating to spools, archaeological sites, spindle whorls, and loom weights in WOLL's "Textile Tool Database" have vanished and are unavailable for download. For that, they could not be added to this repository.</sub>

**Breakdown of Repository Contents:**

<sub> **System of folders:** This repository is divided into two folders with two additional files. One folder corresponds to the dataset from NOAA, and the other for files originating from the repository WOLL. For ease of use, **all files from NOAA appear in a folder titled "Hawaiian Monk Seal Telemetry Tag Deployments"**, and **all files from WOLL (provided by the *Exzellenzcluster Topoi 264*) are located in a folder titled "The Textile Revolution"**. The folder containing files from the repository WOLL has four subfolders for each of its datasets, with their contents displayed below.</sub>

**Purpose of Files in Respository:**
1) **ISO-19139 Metadata:** Metadata corresponding to the ongoing collection of live telemetry studies of Hawaiian monk seals by NOAA's Hawaiian Monk Seal Research Program.
2) **PSD_HMSRP_Telemetry_Tag_Deployments.csv:** Table containing seal IDs, ages, sexes, names and nicknames, as well as dates of tracking and satellite/transmission locations.
3) **NOAA_data_management_plan.pdf:** A brief description of NOAA's Master Data Management Plan, including the study's name, summary, scope, agents, institutions, and contact information.
4) **metadata_artefakte:** A metadata file containing relevant archaeological information such as catalog number, excavation number, materials found, weight, site name, geospatial location of recovery, etc. concerning materials recovered in southwest Asia and southeast Europe relating to wool fiber processing in the 7th-2nd millenium BC.
5) **wollschaf_artefakte.csv:** A table containing similar information to the metadata file; a comprehensive and detailed list of artifacts in repository, the largest portion of which being textile tools and textile imprints on ceramic potsherds.
6) **pollen_field_doku:** Metadata file containing geospatial and geochemical information regarding level of soil enrichment with specific pollens during neolithic/bronze age domestication of sheep for raw fiber processing into textiles.
7) **wollschaf_pollen (1).csv:** Table containing latitude, longitude, site names, depositional environments, dating methods, ages, and species of pollen collected.
8) **Wollschaf_Bone_Database_Metadata_2019_09_12.pdf:** A short paper providing geographical and chronological frames to the archaeozoological analysis of domestic sheep bones collected and anaylyzed between southwest Asia and southeast Europe in the 7th-2nd millenium BC.
9) **knochen_field_doku:** Metadata concerning a set of several hundred Neolithic/bronze age bones from *Ovis/Capra* domestic animals, includingkey statistics.
10) **01 Site Core Data.xls:** Table containing site coordinates, settlement category, chronological range, culture group, bone counts, site name, and site IDs.
11) **02 Site Bone Data(01).xls:** Table concerning site name, location, as well as bone counts, and statistics (sex, age, withers height, etc.).
12) **03 Ovis Bone Metrics.xls:** Table containing information on specific bone metrics, including bone ID, skeletal element identifiers, and reference bone metrics.
13) **04 Bibliography.xls:** A comprehensive bibliography (reference in database, full academic reference) of all authors cited in the "Bone Database" project.
14) **metadata_tools:** Metadata concerning a set of 1048 textile tools sampled within a site cluster on the Pannonian Plain, relating to raw fiber processing.
15) **TEXTILE TOOL DATASET.pdf:** A short paper providing a geographical and chronological frame to the study "Archaeological Evidence for Early Wool Exploitation in South-East and East Central Europe". 
16) **03 SPOOLS.xlsx:** A table containing the list of objects, identifiers, materials, dates, and resident institutions of objects examined during study of textile tools.
17) **Final Report and Additional Information About this Repository_.pdf:** A paper containing improved versions of intermediate assignments (Data and Metadata Profile, Repository Profile) for LIS 545 B, as well as additional ethical and technincal considerations regarding the creation of this repository.
